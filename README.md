FirePick Delta (FPD) core mechanical design

FirePick Delta is a 3-axis rotational delta factory robot.
Rotational delta robots are fast and precise, which makes them
ideal for pick and place operations. The overhead mounting of
the rotational delta motor maximizes workspace usage since
the motion axes "drop into the workspace". The rotational delta
factory robot is not intended for applications requiring side-torque
(e.g., milling), which are best handle by other machine topologies.

This repository specifies the canonical FirePick Delta DIY build
